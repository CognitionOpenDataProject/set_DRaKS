For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2 (also refer to section 2.1.4.). Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> As shown in Table 1, for each of the pitch, timbre and spatial deviant conditions, participants greatly preferred the control melodies to the altered melodies. There were no significant correlations between musical training and either the preference or pleasantness measures for any of the manipulation comparisons (all Pearson’s r’s < 0.2, all p’s > 0.20).
